    <h1>Hi, I am Lubabalo Mbulawa</h1>
    <p>
        I’m a passionate software development student with a strong desire to create innovative solutions through code. Currently studying at We think code, I’m gaining hands-on experience in various programming languages such as Python and Java. I enjoy tackling challenges and continuously learning to enhance my skills in software engineering.

        My goal is to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world problems, collaborate on impactful projects, and keep pushing the boundaries of what I can accomplish in the tech world.

        I thrive in both individual and team settings and believe that great software is built through collaboration, creativity, and constant learning.
